# Automated arXiv Research Blog Generator\
Description: Developed an automated content generation system that monitors arXiv for new research papers and creates structured blog posts for technical content sharing. The system intelligently tracks processed papers to avoid duplication and only generates content when new research is published.
Key Features:
Automated paper discovery and content extraction from arXiv API
Intelligent duplicate detection and tracking system
AI-generated visual content creation for social media engagement
Cross-platform content distribution with automated social media posting
Scheduled execution using GitHub Actions for continuous operation
Static site deployment through GitHub Pages
Technologies Used:
Python - Core scripting and arXiv API integration
AI Image Generation APIs - Automated visual content creation
Meta Threads API - Social media automation and cross-posting
GitHub Actions - Automated workflow scheduling and CI/CD
GitHub Pages - Static site hosting and deployment
JSON - Data persistence for tracking processed papers
Git - Version control and automated content publishing
Impact: Created a comprehensive content automation pipeline that transforms academic research into engaging multi-format content across platforms, reducing manual effort from daily tasks to zero-maintenance operation while building audience engagement through AI-enhanced visual storytelling.
